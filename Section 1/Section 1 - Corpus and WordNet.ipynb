      "SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS South Korea ' s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down , Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn - je said . \n",
      "He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment , speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \" at a proper level .\" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time . \n",
      "South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won . \n",
      "The U . \n",
      "S . \n",
      "Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U . \n",
      "S ., Which rose to 7 . \n",
      "4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4 . \n",
      "3 billion dlrs in 1985 . \n",
      "Kim , who is also economic planning minister , said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy , but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years . \n",
      "\" Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth , five billion dlrs of ( current account ) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year . \n",
      "But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected ,\" he said . \n",
      "Trade ministry officials said South Korea ' s exports rose 35 pct to 9 . \n",
      "34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year , while imports rose only 8 . \n",
      "5 pct to 8 . \n",
      "2 billion dlrs . \n",
      "Kim said the swing of South Korea ' s current account to a surplus of 4 . \n",
      "65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant . \n",
      "The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time . \n",
      "South Korea ' s foreign debt , which fell to 44 . \n",
      "5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46 . \n",
      "8 billion in 1985 , is still among the largest in Asia . \n",
      "\" This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development ... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country ' s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991 , from about 50 pct in 1986 . \n",
      "\" The government , however , does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus ,\" he said . \n",
      "Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul ' s major trading partners , particularly the United States . \n",
      "\" We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt , but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices , sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance ( CPA ) said . \n",
      "The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11 - member CPA which began on Monday . \n",
      "They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices . \n",
      "Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon . \n",
      "Prices , under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses , recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules . \n",
      "The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre - set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise . \n",

      "The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week , after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa . \n",
      "Since prices are below the \" may - buy \" level of 1 , 655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact , the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market , they said . \n",
      "Delegates and traders said they expected the manager , Juergen Plambeck , to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force . \n",
      "The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system , not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord . \n",
      "The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials , ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa . \n",
      "Purchases from non - members , such as Malaysia , will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby , intermediate and forward positions . \n",
      "The council meeting , which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself , was continuing , the delegates said . \n",
      "The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations . \n",
      "COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council will take effect immediately , delegates said . \n",
      "That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks , after organizing communication systems and assessing the market , they said . \n",
      "COCOA BUFFER DIFFERENTIALS DETAILED The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure , consumer delegates said . \n",
      "The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials , under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian . \n",
      "Thus , if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1 , 200 stg a tonne , he would accept Ghana offers up to 1 , 337 stg . \n",
      "Differentials were fixed as follows , Country Differential stg / tonne Malaysia 0 Brazil 55 Ivory Coast 67 Cameroun 77 Nigeria 120 Togo 130 Ghana 137 Nigeria ' s differential is on \" landed weight \" terms . \n",

      "He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system , and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins . \n",

      "EC COMMISSIONER WELCOMES COCOA ACCORD The new International Cocoa Agreement should lead to a stabilisation of prices , both benefitting producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in international economic relations , European Community Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said . \n",
      "He said in a statement welcoming the agreement on buffer stock rules reached last week in London that it resulted in large part from initiatives taken by the EC Commission after consumers and producers had reached deadlock in initial negotiations . \n",
      "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE , BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price - support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices , many ICCO delegates and trade sources said . \n",
      "The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 - member ICCO council after two weeks of talks . \n",
      "European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately , but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long . \n",
      "\" If the buffer stock operation is successful , I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further , and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices ,\" a European dealer said . \n",
      "And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying , or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so , the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically , dealers said . \n",
      "The buffer stock is the market - regulating tool of the ICCO , into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre - set stabilization range . \n",
      "A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time . \n",
      "The new rules take effect immediately . \n",
      "The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks , after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market , since prices are below the \" must - buy \" level of 1 , 600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement , the sources said . \n",
      "The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 , 000 tonnes within a five week period , but its approach will be more cautious , buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said . \n",
      "The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , 100 , 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock . \n",
      "ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices . \n",
      "Ivory Coast is the world ' s largest cocoa producer . \n",
      "\" We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market ,\" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned . \n",
      "Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 , 000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee . \n",
      "However , some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact . \n",
      "Ghana , whose high - quality cocoa is the world ' s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country ' s export earnings , made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa , saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock . \n",
      "According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany , \" Consumers weren ' t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules . \n",
      "We reached a very sensitive compromise ... There were no real winners or losers .\" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks , and as a result , doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have , delegates said . \n",
      "Under the new rules , the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas , using price differentials to reflect different qualities . \n",
      "Non - ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock . \n",
      "London cocoa prices traded today around 1 , 300 stg per tonne , down from around 1 , 450 stg in January 1987 and 1 , 750 stg in January 1986 . \n",
      "A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120 , 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it , according to the agreement . \n",
      "The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 , 600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled , or if the buffer stock runs low on funds , it says . \n",
      "The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9 / 12 , ICCO officials said . \n",

      "Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end - April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 , 600 SDR \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second , third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets . \n",

      "The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market . \n",
      "But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 - day average , the indicator which governs his activities , traders said . \n",
      "\" The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa ,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . \n",

      "In these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 tonnes to lift prices above the \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . \n",
      "The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non - members could limit the buffer stock ' s scope for action , dealers said . \n",
      "Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . \n",
      "But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . \n",
      "Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . \n",
      "Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . \n",
      "Ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . \n",

      "Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \" all prognostication \" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be . \n",
      "Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 , 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . \n",

      "The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . \n",
      "\" That sounds like a reasonable strategy . \n",
      "But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,\" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . \n",
      "Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . \n",
      "\" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,\" Roldan said . \n",
      "The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . \n",
      "But he added : \" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels .\" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . \n",
      "Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . \n",
      "\" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,\" one senior coffee dealer said . \n",
      "The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . \n",
      "At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . \n",
      "Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . \n",
      "\" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,\" he said . \n",
      "New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . \n",

      "68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . \n",
      "President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . \n",
      "Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . \n",
      "\" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,\" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . \n",
      "Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . \n",
      "\" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,\" he said . \n",
      "The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . \n",

      "7 mln last year . \n",

      "Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . \n",
      "\" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,\" Eshleman said . \n",

      "S . \n",
      "exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . \n",
      "Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . \n",
      "He said the debt situation was a major consideration . \n",
      "\" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,\" he added . \n",
      "Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . \n",
      "On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . \n",
      "Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . \n",
      "The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . \n",
      "Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . \n",
      "\" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,\" one analyst said . \n",

      "29 billion , market economists polled by Reuters said . \n",
      "Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow . \n",
      "The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January , after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs . \n",
      "As an example they quoted wheat export volume , which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January . \n",
      "A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit , the economists said . \n",

      "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said . \n",
      "Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated . \n",
      "This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work . \n",
      "The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations . \n",
      "The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade . \n",
      "A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend . \n",
      "Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought . \n",
      "One consumer country delegate said this would \" distort , not support \" the market . \n",
      "Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder . \n",
      "On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows . \n",
      "The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices . \n",
      "The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \" must buy \" level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock . \n",
      "Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given . \n",
      "The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets . \n",
      "A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement . \n",
      "Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade . \n",
      "It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes . \n",
      "The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa . \n",
      "Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday . \n",
      "Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia . \n",
      "Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas . \n",
      "The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market . \n",
      "Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa . \n",
      "Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand , forcing all prices lower . \n",
      "The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers . \n",
      "EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations . \n",
      "The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there . \n",
      "One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \" meant to support the market where trade buying is not .\" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers . \n",
      "Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \" posted price \" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers . \n",
      "In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers . \n",
      "COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules , delegates said . \n",
      "While consumers do not yet have a common position , an observer said after a consumer meeting , \" They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive .\" European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect , delegates said . \n",

      "That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules . \n",

      "The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues , delegates said . \n",
      "The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non - member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa , delegates said . \n",

      "\" The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great . \n",

      "First , the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously , delegates said . \n",
      "Under an offer system , the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices , they said . \n",

      "After the plan was presented , working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers , EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal . \n",

      "\" A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term ,\" he said , although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation . \n",
      "The Budget will inspire a lot of short - term confidence but it was \" not a good budget for inflation ,\" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build - up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation . \n",
      "Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the \" leading edge \" of monetary policy , but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front . \n",
      "He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness . \n",

      "But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it . \n",
      "James Capel ' s Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent , Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no \" chickens coming home to roost .\" Richard Jeffrey , who favours the likelihood of a June election , said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory . \n",

      "the problem with a movie like heartbreakers is that as hard as you try to concentrate on the notable qualities of the film -- the clever camerawork , the strong ensemble acting , the deft script -- every time jennifer love hewitt walks into a scene , her breasts take over . \n",
      "even my date noticed the blatant attempts by the filmmakers in drawing all attention to the chests of both sigourney weaver and hewitt . \n",
      "alas , all those breasts are never fully revealed -- like some bad 80 ' s teen horror film censored by jerry falwell . \n",
      "despite the massive amounts of boob time in heartbreakers , the film delivers all the goods of a solid comedic vehicle . \n",
      "max ( weaver ) and page ( hewitt ) are a mother / daughter team who swindle rich guys out of their dollars in a con involving matrimony vows , extramarital trysts , and divorce settlements . \n",
      "sort of like a cross between anywhere but here and the grifters . \n",
      "with the irs hot on their proverbial tails , the duo team up for one last job , bilking cigarette tycoon william b . \n",
      "tensy ( gene hackman ) out of his cash . \n",
      "alas , during the con job , page ends up falling in love with a local bar owner ( jason lee ) , a dead body ends up in their trunk , princess leia shows up as a divorce attorney , and a jilted ex - husband ( ray liotta ) shows up waving a gun and advising group therapy for everyone . \n",
      "the glue that holds this familiar story together lies in the actors involved in the production . \n",
      "hackman delivers a memorable performance as the wheezing , hacking , brown - toothed william b . \n",
      "tensy . \n",
      "jason lee , one of the best young actors working in hollywood these days , brings a warm , subtle touch to his role of the lovelorn bar owner head - over - heels in love with page . \n",
      "weaver delivers another knockout comedic punch as the protective mother max . \n",
      "and hewitt actually pulls together a credible acting job despite the screen time she has to share with her breasts . \n",
      "the best work in the film is given by ray liotta , the most intense man ever to grace the screen . \n",
      "he has the uncanny ability to take one - or two - dimensional roles , in such films as cop land , hannibal , and no escape , and turn in an outstanding , memorable job . \n",
      "the only problem is that i ' m still trying to forget about his roles in turbulence and muppets from space . \n",
      "despite the positives , heartbreakers does have its minor flaws . \n",
      "the \" protective mother \" scenario drags on for too long , and the complete and total ignorance of every male in the film over max and page ' s con jobs is a bit too hard to swallow . \n",
      "and not that i ' m complaining , but who wears skintight dresses every day of the year ? in a nutshell , though , this is a love story . \n",
      "beneath all the lying , the cheating , the backstabbing , the hacking coughs , and the cleavage we find a familiar tale of true love . \n",
      "how sweet it is . \n",
      "susan granger ' s review of \" jeepers creepers \" ( mgm / ua entertainment ) this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped - up bodies down a drainage pipe . \n",
      "when long decides to investigate , there ' s nothing but trouble . \n",
      "\" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? - well , this is it ! \" philips warns . \n",
      "what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged - stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . \n",
      "long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature ' s bizarre feeding habits . \n",
      "on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" jeepers creepers \" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song \" jeepers creepers . \n",
      "\" and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . \n",
      "what ' s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer / director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year - old actor in california . \n",
      "sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . \n",
      "when salva made \" powder \" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . \n",
      "and now , once again , in this mgm / ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio . \n"
