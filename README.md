# Text Processing Using NLTK in Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Text Processing Using NLTK in Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/text-processing-using-nltk-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789348989), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a feature of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. This course includes unique videos that will teach you various aspects of performing Natural Language Processing with NLTKâ€”the leading Python platform for the task. 
In this course, you will learn what WordNet is and explore its features and usage. It will teach how to extract raw text from web sources and introduce some critical pre-processing steps. You will also get familiarized with the concept of pattern matching as a way to do text analysis.
By the end of the course, you will be confident & have covered various solutions, covering natural language understanding, Natural Language Processing, and syntactic analysis.
